# G2M Cab DataSets
In the G2M Insight project for the Cab Investment Firm (mandatory for all specializations), we aim to determine which company—Yellow Cab or Pink Cab—presents a more promising investment opportunity.

Before diving into the results, here are a few important notes:

We utilized five datasets for this analysis, including an additional dataset that outlines U.S. federal holidays.

The datasets used are:

    Cab_Data.csv

    City.csv

    Customer_ID.csv

    Transaction_ID.csv

    US Holiday Dates (2004-2021).csv – This supplementary dataset provides details on U.S. national holidays.
